This project predicts the insurance premium category (e.g., Low, Medium, High) for a customer based on their personal and health-related information.
The goal is to help insurance companies automate risk assessment and price policies more efficiently using Machine Learning.

This is a full ML pipeline project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
